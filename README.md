# orb-ponder
This is a personal attempt to grow as a Rust programmer by writing a CPU ray tracer from first principles. It's called `Orb Ponder` because the first scene everyone raytraces is a sphere, and I've been thinking about that sphere a lot.

I'm generally a novice at Rust, and I'm trying to gain experience using things like traits and `Vec<Box<dyn 'a + Shape>>` in a practical project. That's the first goal of this.

I'm generally a professional at realtime rasterization, which isn't raytracing, but it's sufficiently raytracing-adjacent that it's a fun stretch to figure out the parts I don't know from the parts that I do know.

This means the Rusty parts may look like student work, and the graphics parts may have a lot of unstated assumptions that make sense if you already do this for a living. But someone on Twitter asked for the code, so here it is. Anâ€™ it harm none, do what ye will. :-)

I've been keeping a Twitter thread with realtime commentary and thoughts, updated as I sporadically play with this. https://twitter.com/meggsOmatic/status/1554990114081742849
